XVI-SRC is a Roblox external
 that has been copied from the ethic/atg source code.
 It was created by dtbfed, the developer behind Yuki. According to dtbfed, he purchased the ethic source code for 150 and then proceeded to rewrite the entire external src.
Interestingly, dtbfed is known for criticizing others for using AI in their coding, despite using AI himself.
